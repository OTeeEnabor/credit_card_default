# Credit Card Default EDA and Prediction
This notebooks explores a default payment of credit card clients from Taiwan in 2005. We explore the dataset to see the relationship between the independent variables and the target variable - default status. After the EDA process, we attempt to predict the target variable using machine learning models. 

# Dataset
The dataset was collected from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/default-of-credit-card-clients-dataset/data) and contains information on default payments from credit card clients in Taiwan between April and September 2005. The dataset has 25 variables, including the target variable - default status. 

# Machine Learning
For this classification problem - we have used a logistic regression model and a decision tree model.
